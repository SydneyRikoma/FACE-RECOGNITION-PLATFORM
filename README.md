 # FACE RECOGNITION PLATFORM

---

A lightweight, local face recognition system built with Python and OpenCV. Designed for simplicity and speed, this CLI-based tool allows you to:


1. Register a face by name  â€” captures 200 images and retrains the model from scratch  

2. Recognize faces live â€” identifies known faces and labels unknown ones



No database, no web interface â€” just a clean folder-based dataset and a reliable LBPH model.



---



## FEATURES

\- Folder-based dataset (`data/`) with one folder per person

\- LBPH model retrained after each registration

\- Simple CLI menu with just two options

\- Confidence threshold set to 70 for recognition

\- Works entirely offline






## SETUP



Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy

```



---



## USAGE



Run the script:

```bash

python main.py

```



You'll see a menu:

```

1\. Register a new face

2\. Recognize faces

3\. Exit

```

## FOLDER STRUCTURE



```

FACE RECOGNITION PROJECT/

â”œâ”€â”€ main.py

â”œâ”€â”€ data/              # auto-created folders per person

â”œâ”€â”€ classifier.xml     # trained model

â”œâ”€â”€ labels.npy         # label-to-name mapping

```

## NOTES

\- Press `q` to quit during capture or recognition

\- Model and label map are regenerated after each registration

\- Unknown faces are labeled as "Unknown" and skipped



---



## COMPATIBILITY



\- Python: 3.7+

\- Operating System: Windows, Linux, macOS (requires webcam and OpenCV support)
